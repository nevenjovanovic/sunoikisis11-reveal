<h2>Life of Nicholas, bishop of Modruš</h2>
<p>
	Born in Kotor c. <b>1427</b>. Studied in Venice (Scuola di Rialto) and probably Padua (by 1457 he is a doctor of theology and arts). Bishop in Senj (<b>1457</b>) and Modruš (<b>1461</b>). Legate of pope Pius II in Bosnia (<b>1463</b>) and at the court of Matthias Corvinus. Under pope Paul II (1464-1471), administrator in the Papal State, showing strong intellectual and humanist aspirations. In <b>1473</b>, under Sixtus IV, tried to present himself as worthy of cardinalate (Špoljarić: "the first Illyrian cardinal"). In <b>1474</b>, member of Pietro Riario's entourage. again the Pope's administrator (Spoleto, Perugia, mission to Florence). Died in <b>1480</b>.

<h2>Pietro Riario</h2>
<p>A nephew of Francesco della Rovere (future pope Sixtus IV). Riario was born in 1445, died in 1474. Burckhardt: "in splendour, lacking nothing that human intelligence can invent".</p>
<p>Riario's early death provoked a great number of texts, and much interest.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Oratio in funere Petri cardinalis S. Sixti</h2>
<p>Niccolò Perotti spoke, Nicholas of Modruš published his speech and presented it to the Pope</p>
<p>duo nostra aetate principes eloquentiae<br/>(Gio. Bat. de Giudici, bishop of Ventimiglia, in 1474).</p>
<p>Nicholas' speech was printed seven times 1474-1484<br/>(after Nicholas' death, but still during Sixtus' pontificate!)<br/>in Rome, Padua, and Rostock.</p>
<p>It also exists in seven manuscript copies.</p>
<p>The speech was a kind of propaganda for Sixtus IV.</p>
</section>
<section>
						<h2>Oratio in funere Petri cardinalis S. Sixti: a summary</h2>
						<p>The speaker starts from his own affliction, and from the other cardinals' and Pope's loss.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<p>Then he illustrates the deceased's virtues through the story of his life, stressing his prodigal childhood (Riario predicted his uncle's papacy) and the (brief) cardinalate.</p></section>
					<section>
					<p>
					Nicholas defends Riario from the "wicked and envious tongues", demonstrating Riario's dedication to his duties and to his uncle, largesse to churches, love for his entourage.</p></section>
					<section>
					<p>Riario's death is described in detail (including the <em>novissima verba</em>), as a death of a holy man.</p></section>
					<section>
						<p>There are few direct Biblical quotations and even fewer classical ones.</p>

<h2>Printing history of Nicholas' Oratio</h2>
<p>The fifth edition (Rome: S. Plannck, 1482), preserved in the largest number of copies today, is also</p> <h3>the most carelessly printed </h3>
<p>(though the first, by R. de Vulterris, also shows considerable printer's errors).</p>
<p/>
<p>More errors appear in the second half of the book.</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>The manuscript copies seem to have been done from the printed books (but a thorough examination is pending).</p></section>

<h2>Plannck's (and sometimes others') glaring errors</h2>

</section>

				<section>
<h2>Insights</h2>
					<p>The first printed book by a Croatian author may perhaps look unimpressive today, but it was popular in its time.<br/>This is confirmed by the number of reprints (and their preserved copies) and manuscripts. <br/>It had a propagandistic function in Sixtus IV politics. <br/>Its reception needs further research.<br/>Results could be interesting, as it was one of the <b>earliest</b> funeral orations on the death of a cardinal, and it used the relatively <b>new medium</b> of print, enjoying <b>considerable circulation</b>.</p>
